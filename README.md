## How Can My Lab Help?

The good new is that the client is built for Linux, Mac, Windows you name it. The software can run as a screensaver on your computer so it will only start when you're not using it. 

Once you do or if you need help please contact us at dsl@brocku.ca so we can add you to our list.
